## About
The project is a pursuit of a dream. The goal is to produce small documentaries on various topics, which will be shot and edited with open-source software only.

### Project start
The project will start with the first video, codenamed "Fedora at FOSDEM 2023." and will take place in Brussels at the beginning of February.

### Current status
In Planning. This page is a stub; I'll edit it when I progress.

## Current setup
### Hardware
- I will be using Volla Phone with Volla OS (based on the Android Opensource project)
- I plan to explore Fedora for Mobile, but I am still trying to figure out if I can make it work for the deadline.
- USKEYVISION Vlog Kit Flex-K3 will be helping me with the sound and the light if needed.

### Software
My favorite video editor software is OpenShot so that I will use this initially.
